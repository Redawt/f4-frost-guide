## "Where can I find weapon mods?"

Always read through the Description page of the weapon mods and their FROST patches to get all their requirements, or to follow special installation instructions.

That is my nexus profile, I patched a few weapon mods for FROST.

### [LukeCastellan](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/37574150?tab=user+files)
He made a patch for the *Zap Gun* mod. You should get that mod if you are a fan of makeshift energy weapons.

They made a few patches for different weapon mods.


## Why do weapon mods need a patch for FROST?
 Using them without a patch for FROST can cause several problems like:
* **CTDs** (caused by template issues or mesh problems)
* **Weapons not spawning** on NPCs or elsewhere at all
* NPCs only running around with the new weapon but not with any other weapon
  * This problem gets worse with higher player levels
* **Immersion/Lore breaking** quests, NPCs or items
* New weapons are either **over-powered or under-powered**
* General **balancing issues**
* **Conflicts** with Leveled Lists, World Objects, ...
* ...

Check the load order section on where to put the weapon mods and their FROST patches. 


## How can I patch weapons myself for FROST?
[Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/3628) is an article on how to do that.
You obviously require xEdit and some CK knowledge to patch weapons properly.
