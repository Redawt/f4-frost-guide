# Below Zero - A Fallout FROST modding guide (deprecated)

##  Description
This project *was* a Jekyll-based website which served as a guide for installing the FROST Survival Simulator mod, as well as details about compatabilities, load order structure and good modding practices.
The structure of this website grew in a non-ideal way in the past years, and the Jekyll theme used for the website had a security vulnerability.
For these reasons, the project has been remade from scratch and can now be found [here](https://github.com/Redawt/BelowZeroGuide) instead.
