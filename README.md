# Below Zero - A Fallout FROST modding guide

##  Description
This is a Jekyll-based website which serves as a guide for installing the FROST Survival Simulator mod, as well as details about compatabilities, load order structure and good modding practices.

## A note about the structure
Due to the organic growth of this project, the files and folders are not ideally structured.
I am too busy to fix this at the moment.
