#### Alternative: Unofficial Below Zero Wabbajack

A wabbajack is an automated modlist installer, so it's your go-to solution if you don't want to manually install FROST by following this guide.
Here is a link to the [Unofficial Below Zero Wabbajack](https://github.com/St1ck2k/FROST---Below-Zero-Fallout-4-Wabbajack-Modlist/tree/main)
The Wabbajack is unofficial, use it at your own risk.
