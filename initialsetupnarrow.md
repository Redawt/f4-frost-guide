## Some Assumption
I will assume that you know the following things:
* What a load order is, how to sort your load order and why sorting your load order is important
* How to set up a mod manager and use it
  * (This includes enabling loose files)   
* Just because your game doesn't crash doesn't mean that there are no problems with it
* That F4SE is installed and that you always start the game with F4SE through your mod manager
* Not using a mod manager is a bad idea
* Using two mod managers for the same game causes tons of problems and should not be done under any circumstances!
* NMM, Kortex etc. are all outdated mod managers or arew missing important features. Use Vortex or MO2.
* That you did not install the game in the `Program Files` directory of Windows or in any sub-folder of Program Files
  * Installing Fallout 4 in Program Files causes problems


This guide here doesn't carefully walk you through everything to make a modern all-inclusive setup. 
It only tells you which mods you absolutely need to play FROST.
**You can not skip a single mod in this list!**{: .hili}


## Mod Installation Advice

When the guide says to install a mod, it will be formatted as follows: **Main File - Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch 2.1.2b**{: .hili}. This is referring to the mod's category on Nexus, the file name, and the file version. Sometimes I will leave the file version out though, in that case just download the newest version of the mod.
