## Introduction
The purpose of this **Basic Guide**{: .hili} is to tell you what mods are absolutely needed to play FROST, how to install them, and what you need to do to make a properly workign load order for FROST.

Installing this setup takes less then 5 minutes (without including Download Time).

This guide doesn't tell you how to install general Fallout 4 bug fixes related to engine problems!

## Some Assumption
* **MO2**{: .hili} or **Vortex**{: .hili} are installed to handle your mods for Fallout 4
* Only **one** mod manager manages Fallout 4 on your PC
* You know what a **load order**{: .hili} is and how to sort it
* Fallout 4 is **not** installed in the `Program Files` directory of Windows
* **Loose Files**{: .hili} are enabled (Vortex automatically does this, MO2 does not)
* **F4SE**{: .hili} is installed
* You always start the game with **F4SE**{: .hili} through your mod manager
* **Buffout 4**{: .hili} is installed


**You can not skip a single mod from the Basic Guide! Read everything carefully!**

## Mod Installation Advice

When the guide says to install a mod, it will be formatted as follows: **Main File - Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch 2.1.2b**{: .hili}. This is referring to the mod's **category** on Nexus, the **file name**, and the **file version**.  I will leave the file version out in many cases, in that case just download the newest version of the mod.
