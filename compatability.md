## How can I figure out if a mod is compatible with FROST?

FROST changes is a complete overhaul of the game, so many mods have compatability issues with FROST.
**You can't just install every mod from the Nexus and expect it to work.**

If you want to know if a specific mod is compatible or not, just ask on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/BaKsm7Fn4A).
