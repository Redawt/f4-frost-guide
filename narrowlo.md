#### This section tells you how to sort your load order. It contains rules for sorting your load order, an example load order, and an automatic load order checker at the bottom of the page!


**Sorting your load order correctly is very important!**
**Do not skip this step, and read the sorting rules below carefully.**
{: .warning}

## About LOOT
**LOOT**{: .hili} is a tool that is integrated into **Vortex**{: .hili} and **MO2**{: .hili} and can automatically sort your load order.
Its sorting rules are often outdated when it comes to Fallout 4 mods, especially to FROST. I do not recommend to use it, as it often destroys FROST load orders based on outdated information. **It is not a reliable tool for sorting Fallout 4 load orders!**{: .hili}
LOOT is also not reliable as it doesn't know every plugin, so even if you want to use it, you will still have to sort stuff manually.

Before you start adding additional mods that are not mentioned in the guide, make sure to read the [compatability section](./compatability.html) of the guide! It lists which mods and mod types are problematic, and which are okay to use!

## How to structure your Load Order
The following rules show you how to structure your load order. Please use these rules to sort your load order. An example load order can be found below if you need an example on how it should look like in the end.

*Not all mods appear in the load order, as some don't have an esp/esl/esm plugin file.*

*Mods like Buffout 4 won't appear in your load order for that reason.*

##### This is the start of the load order
{: .hili}

#### 1. Bethesda Files
{: .hili}

- Fallout4.esm
- DLCRobot.esm
- DLCworkshop01.esm
- DLCCoast.esm
- DLCworkshop02.esm
- DLCworkshop03.esm
- DLCNukaWorld.esm


#### 2. Master files
{: .hili}
- Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch.esp
- (Put all .esm files and .esm flagged .esp files here. Example: PANPC.esm, Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch.esp)
- (esm-flagged .esm files have an italic font in the plugin section of MO2)


#### 3. Frost Unrelated Mods I
{: .hili}

- (Put all mods that are unrelated to FROST and don't need a frost patch here)


#### 4. Frost Unrelated Mods II
{: .hili}

- (Put all mods here that need a patch for Frost. Load their frost patches at the section marked down below!)


#### 5. Frost Main Files
{: .hili}

- FROST.esp
- RedsFrostFixes.esp
- aFrostMod.esp
- FROST - UFO4P Patch.esp


#### 6. Other Frost Mods
{: .hili}
- FROST - It Snowed.esp
- (Put all other FROST standalone mods here)


#### 7. Frost Patches
{: .hili}

- (Put all mods here that patch a certain mod for FROST)


#### 8. Frost Cell Fixes (FCF)
{: .hili}

No other files should come after the FCF .esp files. 
The ONLY two exception to this rule are the Satellite Worldmap mod (SatelliteWorldMap.esp), and Item Sorter patches like Complex Sorter patches from xEdit. The two exceptions must be loaded after the FCF files. 
If you don't follow these rules, bad things will happen!

- FCF_Main.esp
- FCF_Previsibines.esp
- (Other FCF patches)

##### This is the end of the load order

## The Ending Of Things
That was the Basic Guide. If you followed everything in this guide, you are ready to play FROST! 
Or you can add other mods to your setup, just make sure to use this Load Order page to put new mods into the right spot.
You can check out the next sections of this website for information about which mods are compatible with FROST, or which mods work well with FROST.
