This guide is still WIP, but it is functional. It contains some TODOs, some spelling erros, the usual. This will be fixed soon, don't worry :D
{:.info}


## Overview
Welcome to {{ site.title }}, a fully modular Fallout 4 FROST modding guide!
This website shows you how you make a proper FROST load order.
You can pick one of two guides, one shows you how to make a proper Fallout 4 setup and Frost setup, the other one just shows you the mods that you absolutely need to play FROST in 2022. Everything that is mentioned in this guide is free to install and doesn't cost anything (with the obvious exception of Fallout 4).


## Read this!
* Everything in this guide is written down for a reason. **Read everything carefully**{: .hili}
* You can **NOT** skip any paragraphs/instructions and expect your game to function as it should.
* Everything is in a **chronological order**{: .hili}. Don't skip around in the different sections, it will only confuse you!
* You should install the all the mods in the chronological order of this guide
* This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge about using a computer
* Help is always available at the [FROST Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/BaKsm7Fn4A)
* Even if you are an experienced mod user already, it is still recommended that you read everything carefully.


## About the Guide(s)
I have two guides for you, the Recommended Guide and the Basic Guide. **Choose one!**
Both are centered around MO2. Why not Vortex? You can find an answer to that question in the FAQ section.
Both guides are made with customisation in mind, which means that after you finished installing everything, the load order sections of the guide tell you where you can put additional mods into your load order. Additional mod recommendations will also be given, together with some information about which mods are compatible with FROST and which are not.


### 1. Recommended Guide
The Recommended Guide will carefully walk you through how to install all the mods you will need for a perfectly stable and content-rich, and most importanly, enjoyable experience. 
* Certain mods in the guide are optional, but most of them can not be skipped!
* The guide is highly accessible for everyone, no matter your modding experience
* The guide will give you a modern, stable and advanced mod setup


### 2. Basic Guide
This guide shows you the most **basic and bare-bones setup**{: .hili} that you can have for FROST. It doesn't get any smaller then that.
It only focuses on the must-use/must-have mods for FROST in order to get all of the main content of the current official Frost Development team, including the most important bug fixes and performance improvements for FROST.
It is recommended to have at least some modding knowledge if you want to use this guide, as this guide doesn't tell you how to install the game or your mod manager. This guide does not contain general bugfixes for Fallout 4.


### About the mods
* Optional mods are flagged with **\*O**{: .hili} in their title.
* All Discord mods mentioned in the guide are entirely optional
* Mods that can only be found on a Discord Server are flagged with **\*D**{: .hili} in their title.
* Mods that need a patch for frost are marked with **\*F**{: .hili} in their title
* The end of the guide will give you an example load order and instructions for where you should put mods that are not mentioned in the guide.

## How to navigate the guide

- [The Midnight Ride Guide](https://themidnightride.github.io/index.html) which heavily inspired this guide. A lot of sections from my guide are identical to the Midnight Ride Guide. If you are planning to make a non-FROST Fallout 4 setup, you should use their guide.
- [u/Kanonking](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kanonking) for making the first proper FROST guide back in 2019 which inspired me and others to make our own guides
- [Argonn](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/37574150?tab=user+files) for putting together a FROST Guide which was more comprehensible then previous guides
- [krrptd](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/35409570) for providing his load order which inspired other FROST guides, and for making the FROST Cell Fixes
- [BSJ Prophet](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/103241948) for making Frost Plus and for always helping me out
